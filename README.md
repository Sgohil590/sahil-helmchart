Node.js Backend â€“ Custom Helm Charts This repository contains custom Helm charts I created for deploying a Node.js backend application on Kubernetes. It includes templates for deployments, services, and ingress, designed for a production-ready setup. Key Features: Helm chart structure with modular templates

Namespace-based separation (backend, database, etc.)

Redis and MySQL service integration

Docker image deployment with AWS ECR support

ImagePullSecrets and environment-specific values.yaml usage

Note: ConfigMaps and Secrets are managed locally and not included in this repository for security reasons

This project showcases my hands-on experience with Helm, Kubernetes, Docker, and DevOps best practices.
